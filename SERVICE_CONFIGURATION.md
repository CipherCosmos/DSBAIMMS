### Database Schema

All services use the shared database models and schemas:
- ✅ Consistent data models across services
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships
- ✅ Audit logging for all operations
- ✅ Role-based access control

### Security Features

- ✅ JWT authentication with Redis session management
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin, HOD, Teacher, Student)
- ✅ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration for frontend integration
- ✅ Audit logging for all critical operations

## Deployment

To deploy the LMS system:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

## Health Checks

All services expose health endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Service health status
- `GET /` - Service information and version

The system is now optimized with only essential services, proper configuration, and no duplicate or unused code.
