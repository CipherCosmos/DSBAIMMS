# Comprehensive LMS Application Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve gaps, inconsistencies, and mock data usage in the LMS application to ensure it follows the comprehensive specification and maintains proper microservice architecture.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Alignment ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Database schema was missing several fields present in the models
**Solution**: Updated `init.sql` to include:
- Missing columns in `classes` table (max_students, description, is_active)
- Missing columns in `subjects` table (description, is_active)
- Missing columns in `users` table (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, qualification, experience_years, specializations)
- Missing columns in `marks` table (is_attempted, attempt_number, is_best_attempt, co_contribution, po_contribution, etc.)
- Missing columns in `questions` table (co_weight, po_auto_mapped, created_by)
- Added missing tables: `teacher_subjects`, `attendance`, `notifications`, `student_semester_enrollments`

### 2. API Gateway Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Kong configuration had incorrect service URLs and missing services
**Solution**: Fixed Kong configuration to properly route to all microservices:
- Fixed service URLs (removed incorrect path suffixes)
- Added missing services: bulk-service, export-service, file-service, monitoring-service
- Ensured proper CORS configuration for frontend access

### 3. Frontend API Client Consolidation ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple duplicate API client files causing confusion

### 5. Docker Configuration Fixes ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Port mapping inconsistencies
**Solution**: Fixed port mappings in docker-compose.yml:
- classes-service: 8004:8004 (was 8023:8004)
- subjects-service: 8005:8005 (was 8024:8005)
- semesters-service: 8006:8006 (was 8022:8006)
